# Argon Browser

Status: Phase 1, Foundation and prototyping (pre-alpha, Milestone 0.1 in progress)  
Base engine: [Firefox / Gecko](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/) · Target platforms: Linux, Windows, macOS

Argon is an open-source desktop web browser forked from [Firefox (Gecko)](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/). It builds from Firefox source into its own product: its own binary, profile directory, vendor, and branding, installed and run alongside (never inside) an existing Firefox. It pairs a layout and workflow inspired by Arc and Zen Browser with native Firefox WebExtensions support and a compatibility bridge for Chromium extensions (Manifest V2 and V3).

## Current project status

The project is in Phase 1, actively building Milestone 0.1 (`Argon 0.1: Visual Foundation`).

The Milestone 0.1 chrome is verified against a real Gecko 159 through
Marionette in an isolated temporary profile (`tests/browser/test_chrome.py`):
the 48 px flat toolbar, the three theme modes, and the tab layout switch work
in real browser chrome while Firefox's own tab element, session, and sidebar
implementation stay in charge. A compiled `argon` binary has not been produced
yet; see [`docs/building.md`](./docs/building.md) for what is and is not
verified.

## Core design and features

### Appearance

Argon uses a flat interface without 3D bevels or heavy drop shadows, built on a `4 px` and `8 px` spatial grid with `8 to 12 px` corner radii. The top toolbar is `48 px` tall. The design tokens are defined in [`argon/design-system/tokens.css`](./argon/design-system/tokens.css), including the `240 px` expanded and `52 px` collapsed sidebar widths and the `120 to 200 ms` motion scale that respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Milestone 0.1 exposes two of those controls at runtime, from the Argon toolbar button: the theme (`#F7F8FA` Light, `#15171B` Dark, or System Auto) and the tab layout. Adjustable accent colours, UI density, and corner radii are specified in the token layer but are not yet exposed in the interface.

### Usability and navigation

Tabs can switch between horizontal and vertical layouts at runtime. A vertical sidebar holds open tabs, pinned tabs, bookmarks, and workspace switchers in one dock, while a compact mode hides secondary chrome to give more room to web content. Workspaces isolate browsing sessions and pair with automatic tab unloading to save memory. Keyboard shortcuts follow operating system conventions and remain user-configurable, including `Ctrl+L` (`Cmd+L` on macOS) for the unified address bar and `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) for the command palette.

### Extensions

Standard Firefox add-ons from Mozilla Add-ons (AMO) run natively. For Chromium packages, the Argon Extension Bridge provides a multi-stage pipeline: a static `manifest.json` analyzer that generates an English compatibility report before installation, a manifest and API shim adapter, a background runtime that bridges Manifest V3 service workers to Gecko's background page model, and a local CRX/ZIP package installer. All extensions run inside Gecko's existing WebExtensions sandbox and permission model.

## Architecture overview

Argon is a fork of Firefox Desktop, maintained as a reviewable change set on top of a pinned upstream revision rather than a full copy of mozilla-central (see [`docs/building.md`](./docs/building.md)). Gecko handles rendering, SpiderMonkey runs JavaScript, Necko manages networking, WebRender handles GPU compositing, and NSS provides cryptography. Argon modifies the front-end layer (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XUL, and Web Components) and the extension subsystem so that site permissions, password management, private browsing isolation, and screen-reader accessibility stay intact across upstream updates.

## Development roadmap

The 28-week schedule below is estimated for a team of 3 to 4 developers working in parallel.

## Building Argon

Argon compiles from a pinned Firefox revision with the Argon change set
applied. Full details, including the identity table and what is verified, are
in [`docs/building.md`](./docs/building.md).

```bash
npm run doctor      # toolchain, RAM, disk, and identity report; changes nothing
npm run fetch       # download and verify the pinned Firefox source
npm run apply       # apply the Argon change set (all-or-nothing, drift-checked)
npm run bootstrap   # let mach install clang, Rust, cbindgen, and node
npm run build       # full build: dist/bin/argon with the Argon identity
npm start           # launch the build with a development profile
npm run package     # distributable archive (argon-*.tar.xz)
npm run flatpak     # single-file Flatpak bundle (argon-*.flatpak / org.argon.browser)
```

The build workspace lives in `~/.cache/argon-build` (override with
`ARGON_WORKSPACE`). A full build needs about 40 GB of disk and, realistically,
8 GB of RAM or more; lower `--jobs` on smaller machines
(`python3 scripts/argon.py --jobs 1 build`) or build on a CI runner.

For CSS/JS/XHTML/FTL work, `npm run build:artifact` downloads Mozilla's
pre-built engine instead of compiling it. Those binaries keep Firefox's native
identity, so artifact builds are a development loop only and cannot be
packaged as Argon.

## Testing

Argon separates fast unit tests from tests that need a real browser.

```bash
# Unit tests (appearance state, extension analyzer, CLI, benchmark registry)
npm test

# Python suites (fork build tooling, branding package)
npm run test:python

# Analyze an extension manifest statically (exit code carries the verdict)
npm run analyze -- path/to/manifest.json

# Browser chrome smoke tests: loads the Argon modules into a real Gecko browser
# inside an isolated temporary profile and asserts on live chrome geometry.
python3 -m venv .cache/browser-venv
.cache/browser-venv/bin/python -m pip install -r tests/browser/requirements.txt
.cache/browser-venv/bin/python tests/browser/test_chrome.py

# Diagnostic side-by-side of a clean Firefox window versus an Argon one
.cache/browser-venv/bin/python tests/browser/diagnose.py
```

Set `ARGON_TEST_BINARY` to point the browser tests at a built Argon
(`~/.cache/argon-build/obj/dist/bin/argon`). Until the first full build exists
they default to the installed Firefox as a Gecko test host; either way they
never touch an existing profile.
Screenshots and the Firefox log land in `artifacts/chrome-smoke/` for review.

The browser tests assert real geometry rather than preferences alone, so they
catch the failure mode where a preference is set but nothing visibly changes.
They also verify that Firefox's native tab element survives a layout switch
instead of being cloned or replaced.

## Development standards and governance

All project artifacts, including documentation, source code, identifiers, comments, commit messages, pull requests, issue tracking, CI/CD configurations, and default UI strings, are written in English.

Argon keeps its own profile root (`MOZ_APP_PROFILE=argon`), remoting name, and vendor, so it never opens, locks, or migrates a Firefox profile in place and never hands URLs to a running Firefox. Argon builds do not set `MOZ_TELEMETRY_REPORTING` or `MOZILLA_OFFICIAL`, and the default preferences turn off Mozilla studies, Normandy experiments, and data submission; `argon.telemetry.enabled` (default `false`) is reserved for Argon's own telemetry, which does not exist yet. Extension code never runs in privileged parent processes.

Repository code is currently covered by the root [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE). Upstream Firefox and Gecko components remain under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/), and distributed binaries follow the [Mozilla Trademark Distribution Policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/trademarks/distribution-policy/) with independent Argon branding. Full specifications and the 12-point beta release checklist are in [`Argon Browser — Implementation Plan.md`](./Argon%20Browser%20%E2%80%94%20Implementation%20Plan.md).
